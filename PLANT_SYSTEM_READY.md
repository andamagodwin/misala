### **Data Structure Mapped:**
- âœ… `class_names` â†’ Used for matching prediction results
- âœ… `common_name` â†’ Display name (e.g., "Turmeric")
- âœ… `scientific_name` â†’ Scientific name (e.g., "Curcuma longa")
- âœ… `luhya_name` â†’ Local name (e.g., "Munyu")
- âœ… `ailment_treated` â†’ What it treats (e.g., "Inflammation, wounds...")
- âœ… `preparation_method` â†’ How to prepare (e.g., "Fresh root grated or...")
- âœ… `dosage` â†’ Usage instructions (e.g., "1 tsp powder or fres...")

## ðŸŽ¯ **How It Works Now:**

1. **User takes/selects photo** â†’ **Gets prediction** (e.g., "Turmeric plant")
2. **Clicks "Learn More"** â†’ **Navigates to plant-detail screen**
3. **System fetches plant info** using `class_names` field
4. **Displays detailed information** about the plant

## ðŸš€ **Test Flow:**

1. **Take a photo** that your ML model predicts as "Turmeric plant"
2. **Click "Learn More"** button in the prediction results
3. **View the detailed plant information** with:
